# SSI Protocol - Roadmap

SSI Protocol evolves slowly. Stability is a feature, not a bug.

**This roadmap is indicative (non-normative)** and does not override the constitutional documents.

---

## Current: v1.0.0-invariant (Constitutional Foundation)

✅ Core invariants defined (SPEC.md)  
✅ Decision ontology established (DECISIONS.md)  
✅ Verification procedures documented (AUDIT.md)  
✅ Fail-closed semantics formalized (FAILURE.md)  
✅ Certification framework published (COMPLIANCE.md)

---

## Next: v1.1.0 (Compliance Tooling)

**Target:** Q2 2026 (indicative)

- [ ] Compliance test suite (automated verification)
- [ ] CLI verification tool (`ssi-verify`)
- [ ] Reference policy examples
- [ ] Auditor certification program
- [ ] RPX record schemas (JSON Schema format)
- [ ] Chain proof schemas
- [ ] Verification report format

---

## Future: v2.0.0 (Ecosystem Expansion)

**Target:** 2027+ (indicative)

- [ ] SSI Explorer (public audit trail viewer)
- [ ] Multi-language SDKs (Python, Java, Rust)
- [ ] Distributed ledger integration (optional)
- [ ] ISO/IEC standards alignment
- [ ] Compliance badge assertion format

---

## Governance Philosophy

**SSI changes require:**
- RFC process (public proposal, multi-stakeholder review)
- Backward compatibility (invariants cannot be weakened)
- Transition periods (12-24 months for ecosystem adaptation)

**Version numbering:**
- **Major versions:** Constitutional changes (rare, RFC-gated)
- **Minor versions:** Tooling, documentation, reference implementations
- **Patch versions:** Bug fixes, clarifications

---

## Timeline Disclaimer

Timelines are **indicative estimates** based on current resources and community feedback. Actual releases depend on:
- RFC process outcomes
- Ecosystem adoption signals
- Regulatory guidance
- Community contributions

**SSI prioritizes correctness over speed.** Rushing constitutional changes would undermine the protocol's stability guarantees.

**Roadmap is non-normative. Actual releases follow RFC process and governance framework.**
